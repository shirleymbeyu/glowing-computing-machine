This hosts my solution to 'iX Mobile Banking Prediction Challenge' on Zindi:

# Research Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict if individuals across Africa and around the world use mobile or internet banking.

# Objectives
Make predictions for each unique id in the test dataset about the likelihood of the person using online/mobile banking,i.e. Yes = 1, No = 0.

Have a project report of the full project process and derivatives from it.

# Business Success Criteria
The solution should provide insight into peopleâ€™s financial behavior in a manner that can help financial services providers, including insurance companies and banks, tailor the services they provide their clients.

# Evaluation
The error metric for this competition is Area Under the Curve (AUC).

N/B: Threshold  (or rounded probabilities) wasn't set as per the rules of the competition.
This was to ensure that the client receives the best solution and allowing them to set thresholds for their own needs.
